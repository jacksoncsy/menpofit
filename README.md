menpofit - A deformable model toolkit
=====================================
State-of-the-art deformable modelling techniques implemented on top of the
Menpo project. Currently, the techniques that have been implemented include:

  - **Active Appearance Models**
    - Project Out
    - Alternating
    - Simultaneous
  - **Lucas-Kanade Image Alignment**
    - Forward Additive
    - Forward Compositional
    - Inverse Additive
    - Inverse Compositional
  - **Active Template Models**
  - **Constrained Local Models**
    - Active Shape Models
    - Regularized Landmark Mean-Shift
  - **Supervised Descent Method**

Installation
------------
Here in the Menpo team, we are firm believers in making installation as simple 
as possible. Unfortunately, we are a complex project that relies on satisfying 
a number of complex 3rd party library dependencies. The default Python packing 
environment does not make this an easy task. Therefore, we evangelise the use 
of the conda ecosystem, provided by 
[Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/). In order to make things 
as simple as possible, we suggest that you use conda too! To try and persuade 
you, go to the [Menpo website](http://www.menpo.io/installation/) to find 
installation instructions for all major platforms.
